Lessons are in class assignments. You have two class days to complete a Lesson. Lessons are collected at random on Fridays.

#### Laptop/Cellphone Policy 

Web surfing, email browsing, gaming, using cell phones and mobile devices, are not permitted during class.

#### Attendance Policy 

After five absences, your final grade will be reduced by half a grade for every additional unexcused absence.

#### Extra Credit 

As a rule, we do not provide extra credit as a means for improving a low test score.

#### Honor Code 

All students are expected to abide by Rose-Hulman's honor code.

#### Learning Outcomes 

Students will be able to write programs that learn from data how to accomplish a specific task. In particular students will be able to

1. identify relevant data features and engineer new ones.
2. optimize hyper-parameters of classifiers/regressors to prevent over/underfitting.
3. use metrics to evaluate the performance of classifiers/regressors.

#### Free Textbook 

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf) by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani.
